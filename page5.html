<img src="images/Jack.png" alt="music">
<P>Jack Stauber stopped posting music publicly because of a couple of reasons <br>
1. People started treating him more as a deity then a normal musician <br>
2. Some people started washiping him for the music he made <br>
3. His album that he was working on got leaked <br> 
He has left the music space for now but most likley not forever <br> 
His last post on his YouTube Channel was in october of 2021 <br>
While his most recent upload on his patreon was January of this year</P></div>
