 <p> Jack Stauber quietly stepped back from the public eye around 2020, <br>
	 slowing down on music releases and online activity. <br>
	 While he hasn't given an official reason, many fans
	  believe he's taking time for himself or working on new creative <br>
	  projects privately. His past work continues to inspire a dedicated fanbase. <br> </p></div>
